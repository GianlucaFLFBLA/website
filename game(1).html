<h2> Information </h2>
<p>The Lost Complex was made using Unreal Engine 5.5. This game engine provides many features such as bleeding edge rendering, physics, and lighting solutions used by indie developers and top AAA studios from around the world. In addition, the Unreal Engine toolkit allows for advanced features such as real time online multiplayer, advanced audio features, and many more features that allow this game to be successful. </p>
<br>
<p>The design tool kit for The Lost Complex includes, Gunu Image Manipulation Software (GIMP), Blender 3.5, and Audacity. GIMP allows for advanced texture manipulation of many assets used in the game. Blenderâ€™s advanced 3D modeling toolkit allows for high quality modeling of any game assets used and overall is a key asset in the creation of the art style of the game. Audacity is required for the modification of voice lines and other audio effects used in the game and overall makes the experience more immersive for the player.</p>
<br>
<p>When all these tools are put together it allows The Lost Complex to immerse the player in this dark and eerie world set outside the confines of our reality. The usage of many tools such as the Unreal Engine Lighting and Rendering Pipeline further cements this ascetic of a clean and low poly environment that's also unpredictable of what will happen next.</p>
